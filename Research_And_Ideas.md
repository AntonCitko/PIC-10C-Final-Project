## This document is a journal for me to keep track of the different ideas and sources I found to help me create a package for R.

The first thing I did to figure out how to make a package for R was to Google what good starting places there are to make packages. A couple of helpful links were:

https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-exts.pdf

http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/code/rcpp/Rcpp-package.pdf

Based on some of my research, it looks like Rcpp is a package designed to integrate C++ with R. Also, it has some very useful functions to create the basis for an R package using Rcpp. I think it would be a good stepping stone that would help reduce some of the initial chores to creating a package.
